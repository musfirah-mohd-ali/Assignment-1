# ComfortDelGro Website Revamp
The original website and company I chose to revamp was ComfortDelGro's Driving Centre website. As a person taking her driving license there, I find the original website tacky and hard to use due to its unmodern and non-user-friendly UX and UI. I chose this website as I have an in-depth understanding of its features and how it works, and believe I can update it to a more modern website that better suits the needs of its users.

## User Audience Intent and Purpose
### Who is the website catering for?
The website caters to individuals who are already taking their driver's license, those planning to enroll into the CDC and those wanting to book lessons.

### Purpose and Value Provided:
1. Learners
    * Provides a simplifies and easy user experience to book, cancel and/or manage lessons inline.
    * Offers clear, streamlines navigation to acess essential features like transaction history and reprinting receipts.
    * Improves accessibility for users with minimal technical expertise by delivering an easy-to-use interface.
2. ComfrotDelGro
    * Enhances the company's digital presense by creating a modern, user-friendly website.
    * Encourafes direct engagement with users, reducing reliance on third-party booking platforms.
    * Aliigns teh website with modern web design stadards to boost credibility and usability.

## What is the Website Catering for?
The website is designed to address the core needs of leaners at the driving center, such as:
    - Booking driving lessons conveniently.
    - Managing lesson schedules effectiverly (rescheduling, cancellation etc.)
    - Tracking tranactions for payment transparency.
    - Reprinting receipts for personal or official records.

## Design Process
I changed the entire aesthetic due to how cluttered the original design looked. From being messy and overwhelming, I wanted to make it look more "aesthetic" and "minimalistic." Keeping with the original color scheme, I changed the fonts and layout to make it sleek and modern. The goal was to ensure the website is user-friendly, so that both new learners signing up and existing learners can easily navigate the site. By simplifying the design, I believe this revamp will encourage more users to book lessons directly through the site, instead of relying on third-party sources.

## User Stories:
1. As a learner, I want to book a driving lesson easily, so that I can schedule my lessons without frustration.

2. As a learner, I want to cancel my booking, so that I can make changes to my schedule if necessary.

3. As a learner, I want to re-print my receipt, so that I can have a copy for my records.

4. As a learner, I want to view my transaction history, so that I can keep track of my payments and bookings.

## Wireframes and Mockups:
Wireframes were created in Figma to visualize the layout and flow of the website. These wireframes helped guide the design process, ensuring that each page and feature was streamlined and easy to use. Here is a link to the Figma wireframes.
