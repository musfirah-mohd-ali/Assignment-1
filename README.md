# ComfortDelGro Website Revamp
The original website and company I chose to revamp was ComfortDelGro's Driving Centre website. As a person taking her driving license there, I find the original website tacky and hard to use due to its unmodern and non-user-friendly UX and UI. I chose this website as I have an in-depth understanding of its features and how it works, and believe I can update it to a more modern website that better suits the needs of its users.

## Design Process
I changed the entire aesthetic due to how cluttered the original design looked. From being messy and overwhelming, I wanted to make it look more "aesthetic" and "minimalistic." Keeping with the original color scheme, I changed the fonts and layout to make it sleek and modern. The goal was to ensure the website is user-friendly, so that both new learners signing up and existing learners can easily navigate the site. By simplifying the design, I believe this revamp will encourage more users to book lessons directly through the site, instead of relying on third-party sources.

## User Stories:
As a learner, I want to book a driving lesson easily, so that I can schedule my lessons without frustration.

As a learner, I want to cancel my booking, so that I can make changes to my schedule if necessary.

As a learner, I want to re-print my receipt, so that I can have a copy for my records.

As a learner, I want to view my transaction history, so that I can keep track of my payments and bookings.

## Wireframes and Mockups:
Wireframes were created in Figma to visualize the layout and flow of the website. These wireframes helped guide the design process, ensuring that each page and feature was streamlined and easy to use. Here is a link to the Figma wireframes.

## Features
