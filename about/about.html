            <h2>Website Revamp Process</h2>
            <p>Our website revamp project was driven by the need to improve user experience (UX) and interface (UI) design for both new and existing learners. The old website was difficult to navigate and looked outdated, making it hard for users to find essential features.</p>
            <p>We focused on creating a more modern, aesthetic, and user-friendly design. The new website keeps the original color scheme, but it has a cleaner layout, updated fonts, and easy-to-use navigation. This makes booking, viewing transactions, and cancellations much easier for our learners.</p>
